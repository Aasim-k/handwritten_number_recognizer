# handwritten_number_recognizer
Handwritten Digit Recognizer ✍️🔢 Web app lets you draw a number (0–9) directly in your browser and instantly predicts it using a trained SVM model on the classic MNIST dataset. The drawing is captured from a canvas, carefully resized and centered into a 28×28 pixel format, and then passed to the saved svm_mnist_model.pkl for recognition.
